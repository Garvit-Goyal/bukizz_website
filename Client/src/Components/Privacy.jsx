          Offer Wall. Our application(s) may display a third-party hosted "offer

          6/8 or other items to users in return for the acceptance and
          completion of an advertisement offer. Such an offer wall may appear in
          our application(s) and be displayed to you based on certain data, such
          as your geographic area or demographic information. When you click on
          an offer wall, you will be brought to an external website belonging to
          other persons and will leave our application(s). A unique identifier,
          such as your user ID, will be shared with the offer wall provider in
          order to prevent fraud and properly credit your account with the
          relevant reward.

      <h1>4. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?</h1>
      <p>

        inclusion of a link towards a thirdparty website, service, or
        application does not imply an endorsement by us. We cannot guarantee the
        safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data
        collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are
        not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and

        and store your information.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons
        and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about
        how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is
        set out in our Cookie Notice.
      </p>
      <h1>6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h1>
      <p>
        In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a
        social media account, we may have access to certain information about
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your
        third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter
        logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile
        information about you from your social media provider. The profile
        information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider
        concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends
        list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to
        make public on such a social media platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are
        described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you
        on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are
        not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your
        third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their
        privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your
        personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on
        their sites and apps.
      </p>
      <h1>7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h1>
      <p>
        In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill
        the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required
        by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
        require us keeping your personal information for longer than four (4)
        months past the termination of the user's account.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
        information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
        securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
        processing until deletion is possible.
      </p>
      <h1>8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h1>
      <p>
        In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system
        of organizational and technical security measures.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
        organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any
        personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
        efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
        Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
        secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals,
        or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
        security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
        information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
        information, transmission of personal information to and from our
        Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within
        a secure environment.
      </p>
      <h1>9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h1>
      <p>
        In Short: You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process
        your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent
        depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your
        consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by
        contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW

        processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will
        it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in
        reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
      </p>

      <h1>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h1>
      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
        activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
        online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
        uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
        has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
        signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
        choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
      </p>
      <h1>11. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h1>
      <p>
        In Short: Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant
        with relevant laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version
        will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date and the updated version
        will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material
        changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently
        posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a
        notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently
        to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
